# SP500_Calculator
Computes stock performances of the top 500 companies in America and compares performance based on sector.

## Introduction
For the longest time, I've always loved comparing the best and worst performing stocks in a given year. It's always intriging to observe which sectors underperformed and overperformed.
Unfortunately, I was unable to locate charts attuned to my specifics, so I've opted to create my own calculations this time. 

## Methodology
The criteria for this project is calcualting the yearly stock performance in the world's most popular index; the SP500. All the comapanies included in this project are those that listed in the SP500
as of December 31st 2025. Stocks that were ejected from the index that year are not included in this calculator. The performance benchmark is the percentage difference between the opening price of 
the first trading day of 2025 and the closing price of the final day of 2025. 

## Tools
The following tools were used to complete this project:
- Python (Pandas, yfinance)
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts)
